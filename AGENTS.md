# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the library implementation (core image/geometry, matching, measure, platform).
- `include/` exposes public headers, typically under `QiVision/` namespaces.
- `samples/` holds runnable example programs (e.g., shape matching demos).
- `tests/` currently contains test assets under `tests/data/` used by the test binary.
- `third_party/` contains vendored dependencies (currently `stb`).
- `build/` is the default out-of-tree build directory; binaries land in `build/bin/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Configure + build (Release):
  - `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
  - `cmake --build build --parallel`
- Run unit tests: `./build/bin/unit_test`
- Run a sample: `./build/bin/samples/08_shape_match_large`
- Useful CMake options: `-DQIVISION_BUILD_TESTS=ON` and `-DQIVISION_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- C++17 is required; follow existing 4-space indentation and brace-on-same-line style (see `src/Core/QImage.cpp`).
- Naming conventions (from `docs/CODING_STYLE.md`):
  - Namespaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Qi::Vision::Matching`).
  - Classes: `PascalCase` with `Q` prefix for core types (`QImage`).
  - Functions: `PascalCase` (`CreateShapeModel()`), variables: `camelCase`.
  - Private members: trailing underscore (`data_`), constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - Filenames: `PascalCase` (`ShapeModel.cpp`).
- Follow API verb patterns like `Create*`, `Find*`, `Read*`, `Write*`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests are executed via the `unit_test` binary generated by CMake.
- Test assets live in `tests/data/`; run tests from the repo root so relative paths resolve.
- If adding new test data, follow the existing directory pattern under `tests/data/<module>/...`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit format (from `docs/CODING_STYLE.md`): `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `perf`, `chore`.
  - Example: `fix(ShapeModel): correct angle interpolation`.
- Branch naming examples: `feature/<module>-<brief>`, `fix/<issue>-<brief>`, `refactor/<scope>`.
- PRs: include a concise summary, steps to verify (commands + expected output), and sample screenshots/logs if behavior changes.

## Configuration Notes
- Build artifacts are under `build/` by default; keep it out of commits.
- Large binary assets should remain in `tests/data/` or `samples/` and not in `src/`.
